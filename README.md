# Recommender System using Collaborative Filtering
This project implements a recommender system using collaborative filtering algorithms, specifically user-based and item-based approaches. The system utilizes the Surprise library, which provides a collection of ready-to-use algorithms for recommendation tasks.

Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing movie ratings, which is loaded from a CSV file (ratings.csv). The dataset includes information about users, movies, and their corresponding ratings.

Installation
To run the recommender system, you need to install the required dependencies. Execute the following command to install the scikit-surprise library:

diff
Copy code
!pip install scikit-surprise
Usage
Import the necessary libraries and mount the Google Drive where the dataset file is located.
Load the dataset from the CSV file and preprocess it using the Surprise library.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Implement collaborative filtering algorithms:
User-based collaborative filtering: This approach analyzes the similarity between users and makes recommendations based on the ratings of similar users.
Item-based collaborative filtering: This approach identifies similarities between items (movies) and generates recommendations based on those similarities.
Evaluate the performance of the algorithms by calculating the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on the test set.
Optionally, implement a hybrid recommender system that combines the predictions of user-based and item-based algorithms.
Evaluate the performance of the hybrid recommender system.
Results and Recommendations
Based on the evaluation, the item-based collaborative filtering algorithm performed better, achieving an RMSE of 0.8600, compared to the user-based algorithm with an RMSE of 0.8862. Additionally, a hybrid recommender system combining both algorithms achieved an improved RMSE of 0.8529.

To further improve the recommender system, the following recommendations can be considered:

Optimize hyperparameters: Experiment with different parameter settings to achieve better performance.
Explore different algorithms: Try out various collaborative filtering algorithms provided by the Surprise library or explore other recommendation algorithms.
Incorporate additional features: Enhance the recommender system by including additional features such as movie genres, user preferences, or contextual information.
Summary
In summary, this project demonstrates the implementation of collaborative filtering algorithms for building a movie recommender system. By evaluating user-based, item-based, and hybrid approaches, it was found that the hybrid recommender system provided the best performance. Further improvements can be made by optimizing hyperparameters, exploring different algorithms, and incorporating additional features.
